ardrone_vicon
====
This repository documents some works on an ardrone project using vicon.


Systems work on
-----
Ubuntu14         &nbsp;    &nbsp;   ROS indigo  <br>
Ubuntu16           &nbsp;    &nbsp;          ROS kinetic

How to use vicon to communicate with your ROS
-----
For now, you have _vicon_ and two computers: one is ubuntu computer and the other one is windows computer where the _vicon tracker_ is installed.<br>
We need a router to help the computers connect with vicon: close DHCP function and insert both vicon and your computers into the ethernet interfaces.
<br> Then we need to put vicon and your computers under one network segmentï¼šthe default IP address of vicon is 192.168.10.1, so we can configure the router's IP address(now we uses it as a switch) as 192.168.10.254 and your ubuntu computer's IP address as 192.168.10.253. Your windows computer is 192.168.10.1 since it has _vicon tracker_ already been installed before.
<br> Now, all the hardware connection is finished.
<br>

Download and set up workspace
---
This repository consists of three packages, `ardrone_autonomy` is the driver of ardrone which is the basis of all ardrone projects; `vicon_bridge` is created to connect ROS with vicon and receive data. These two packages have been created by some genius long before.
<br> `ardrone_vicon` is a package that performs several functions based on these two packages. You can get started quikly using the following command:
<br>First, we need to create a ROS workspace:
```
mkdir vicon
cd vicon
mkdir src
cd src
catkin_workspace_init
cd ..
catkin_make
```
Then, you can download packages:
```
cd src
git clone https://github.com/Shicheng-Liu/ardrone_vicon.git
cd ..
catkin_make
```
Finished!
<br>You may also want to add path to the evironment:
```
gedit ~/.bashrc

///add this line at the bottom
source ~/vicon/devel/setup.bash
```
Make your change into effect:
```
source ~/.bashrc
```

How to use functions
--
Before using _ardrone_vicon_, make sure you have followed all the steps above successfully.
<br> Open _vicon tracker_ and choose object, connect the WIFI of your ardrone.
<br> Open a terminal:
```
roslaunch ardrone_vicon ardrone.launch
```
Open another terminal:
```
rosrun ardrone_vicon ardrone_vicon_node
```
Since we have added path to the environment, we have no need to source the environment now. Now you will see a menu like this:
        
   ![menu](https://github.com/Shicheng-Liu/ardrone_vicon/blob/master/menu.png)
<br>
Choose y to take off is always the first step, and then you can choose functions you want.
<br>

Funtions Introduction
-
**k  :  keyboard control**
<br> You will see a new menu like this after you press k:

<br>
The drone will act exactly like the menu says.
<br>
<br>
**a  :  calibration**
<br> 
The drone will calibrate its angle and position, the angle will be less than 8 degree and the position will be about the origin.
**NOTE** : In my scenario, the coordinate system of drone is different from that of _vicon_ : The x axis of drone is actually the -y axis of _vicon_ and the y axis of drone is actually the -x axis of _vicon_. Accordingly, if your situation is different, please go to _ardrone_vicon.cpp_ and change the coordinate system.
<br>
<br>
**b  :  trajectory**
<br>
The drone will move to (0,0) (1,1) (1,-1) (-1,-1) (-1,1) (0,0)
<br>
<br>
**c  :  pose measurement**
<br>
You will see the basic state if your drone, like the position in 3D dimension and the angle of the drone.
<br>
<br>
**f  :  target follow**
<br> 
First, you need to add a new object in _vicon tracker_ and name it _target_.<br>
Then you can use this funtion: the drone will track target wherever you move the target. This funtion uses simple difference to realize following and the drone will be about 2 meters away from the target.
<br>
<br>
**p  :  potential field track**
<br>
This function is similiar to _target follow_ but uses a different method [potential field](http://kovan.ceng.metu.edu.tr/~asil/old/_1./wh2.html)
<br> The drone will track your target.
<br>
<br>
**l  :  potential field repulse**
<br>
This funtion is at the opposite of track: the drone will move away from the object as if the target has a repulsive power.
<br> First, you need to add sa new object in _vicon_tracker_ and name it _obstacle_.
<br> Then you can find the drone moving away from the obstacle.
<br>
<br>
**m  :  potential field track with obstacle**
<br>
This function is a combination of the last two functions, you can track a tracking while avoiding an obstacle.
